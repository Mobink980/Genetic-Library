# Genetic Library Web Project
A web project, containing the implementation of Genetic Algorithms, such as Selections, Crossovers, and Mutations. This program is intended to be a genetic library for research and development.
<h2>Genetic Library Web Project Under Development</h2>
<p> In the following, there is a brief description of the project.</p>
<h4>Sign up section: </h4>
<p>For users to register to the website. Users who are registered, can comment, they can vote on the codes about whether 
they are helpful after reaching to a certain level or gathering enough points. Users who are registered should be able to ask questions, contribute to the project, and create a community to help each other in evolutionary algorithms. Users can rise their level by contributing helpful information, upvoting useful materials, making correction to the codes, etc.</p>
<h4>Sign-in or Login section: </h4>
<p>For users to enter to their home page, after their first registration.</p>
<h4>Search section: </h4>
<p>The project needs a search section, so the contents that the user searches would come up and be shown to the user. If the 
contents could not be found within the website, the relevent contents and helpful links should be suggested to user, from Google Books, Academia, and other helpful scientific resources.</p>
<h4>Cookies section: </h4>
<p>We need cookies, to save and gather information from our users by their permission to provide them user-specific services. 
These services could be emails to the users based on the contents that he or she searched before, telling them about the events that they might be interesteed in, etc.</p>
<h4>FAQ section:</h4>
<p>In this section, the users can see the questions that are frequently asked with their relevent answers.</p>
<h4>Comment section:</h4>
<p>In this section, we recieve the suggestions of the users to make the contents of the website more useful and helpful to our users.</p>
<h4>Contribution section:</h4>
<p>In this section, we must provide the users to contribute scientific resources by reference; contribute codes to the specified algorithms, or implement and upload another genetic algorithm.</p>
